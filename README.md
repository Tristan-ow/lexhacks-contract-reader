Lexhacks 2015 hackathon project (contract parser)

To test the parser edit the below line at the end of test-parse.py to point at your sample documents. You can also set a limit on the number of documents to scan with the second argument (e.g., 170 in the example below):

```

parseSamples('samples/2014/QTR1', 170)

```

Then run test-parse.py from the command line:

```

python test-parse.py

```
